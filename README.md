# Advanced Calculator

This is an advanced calculator that follows the PEMDAS order of operations. The calculator supports a wide range of functions including trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan), logarithmic functions (ln, log), square roots, and the mathematical constants π and e. The user interface has been developed using Jetpack Compose for a modern and responsive design.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- **Trigonometric Functions**: Sine (sin), cosine (cos), tangent (tan)
- **Logarithmic Functions**: Natural logarithm (ln), common logarithm (log)
- **Square Roots**: Compute square roots
- **Constants**: π (Pi), e (Euler's number)
